# tripex-pol-ACP-2022
Collection of codes to be used for the snow polarimetric and multifrequency characterization paper.
In the folder DWR-classes contains all codes used to classify the dataset into DWR-classes and generate Figures 4 to 7. Calc_mean.py is used to calculate the 5 minute mean in periods where the polarimetric W-band radar was measuring at 30Â° elevation. classifyPolACP.py and classifyPolFuncACP.py contain the main code used for the classification. plotPaper and plotDWRclassesfuncs.py are used to plot. 
Similarly, CTT-classes is used to classify the dataset into CTT classes. 
The linked github repository tripex-pol was used to reprocess the zenith and polarimetric dataset. Further description is given in there.
In snow-simulations-idealized you can find all codes used for the scattering calculation provided in the appendix of the paper.
